# An Open Source, Cloud Native Geospatial Catalog.
{: .fs-9 }

The geocore geospatial library is a cloud-first solution for search, discovery, and dissemination of geospatial content. Building on the ideas of open source geospatial catalogs such as geonetwork and spatial temporal asset catalogs (STAC), we have combined the best practices and flexibility of these technologies for the cloud age. It is built using Amazon Web Servicesâ€™s managed services as microservices to reduce overall cost of development and maintenance. The flexibility of this system lies in the geocore storage format. The geocore format is an extended [geoJSON](https://geojson.org/) that allows the user to not only provide geospatial information about the content, but all the required and optional metadata associated with the item.
